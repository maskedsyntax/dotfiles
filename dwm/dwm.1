.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

In tiled layout windows are managed in master and stacking areas. The master area contains the window which currently needs most attention, whereas the stacking area contains all other windows. In monocle layout all windows are maximised to the screen size. In floating layout windows can be resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating, regardless of the layout applied.

Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.

Each screen displays exactly one tagset at a time. A tagset is a group of selected tags. The selected tags of a screen can be changed using the mouse or keyboard.

Configuration is done by creating a custom config.h before compiling.
